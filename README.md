# Marine Vessel Proximity Analysis

This assignment project demonstrates how to calculate marine vessel proximity events using Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Math. It utilizes the Haversine formula. It also showcases the Pandas vectorization method and visualizes the final result using Plotly.

## Project Structure

- **data/sample_data.csv**: Contains the Vessel locations, Vessel IDs, and Timestamp data.
- **src/Marine_Vessel_Proximity_Analysis.py and Marine_Vessel_Proximity_Analysis.ipynb**: Python scripts to run the analysis.
- **README.md**: Assignment documentation.
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2. Install required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the analysis script:

    ```bash
    python src/Marine_Vessel_Proximity_Analysis.py
    ```
